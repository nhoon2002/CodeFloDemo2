# CodeFlo
----------
CodeFlo is a full-stack social networking application, built from scratch by developers [Alex Nam Kim](https://github.com/nhoon2002) & [Henry Lee](https://github.com/henhen87). This project was our ambitious attempt at a MERN stack social networking service, complete with rich features such as real-time chat, team builder, todo list, etc.

Our goal was to build a platform for all individuals who have a great app idea, but do not have the man power or expertise to make it come to fruition. CodeFlo hopes to make it easier for ideas to flow and keep flo'ing.
